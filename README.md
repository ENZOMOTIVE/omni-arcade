# Omni Arcade

> Omni Arcade is a mobile application project with the structure needed for Android, wallet, or React Native style development.

## The Story

Omni Arcade starts with a simple goal: shape a mobile experience that is easy to install, test, and hand off. Its shape tells the same story: the product interface, the service layer, and the mobile surface live close enough together that a maintainer can see the project as a whole before diving into individual folders.

## What It Includes

- A user-facing surface for the product, demo, dashboard, or static experience.
- A service layer for APIs, realtime behavior, bot logic, or server-side workflows.
- Mobile-ready project structure for wallet, Android, or app-focused development.

## How It Is Put Together

| Path | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `.gitattributes` | project file or folder |
| `omni-arcade` | project file or folder |

## Local Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ENZOMOTIVE/omni-arcade.git
cd omni-arcade
```

```bash
cd omni-arcade
npm install
npm start
```

## Command Surface

| Area | Commands |
| --- | --- |
| `omni-arcade/package.json` | `start`, `reset-project`, `android`, `ios`, `web`, `lint` |

## Configuration

- Document API ports, database URLs, third-party credentials, and service endpoints in `.env.example` before deployment.
- Keep signing keys, platform credentials, and build profiles outside the repository.

## Quality Checks

- From `omni-arcade`, run `npm run lint`.

## Where To Take It Next

- Add screenshots or a short user flow so visitors can see the interface before running it.
- Document the main API routes, bot events, or service responsibilities with example inputs and outputs.
- Add emulator, device, signing, and release notes for the mobile workflow.
- Keep setup commands current whenever dependencies, scripts, or deployment targets change.
- Record important product decisions here so the repository keeps its story as the code evolves.
