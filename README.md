# Omni Arcade

> Omni Arcade is a single app that brings multiple small games into one arcade-style experience.

## The Story

Omni Arcade starts with a simple goal: shape a mobile experience that is easy to install, test, and hand off. Its shape tells the same story: the product interface, the service layer, and the mobile surface live close enough together that a maintainer can see the project as a whole before diving into individual folders.

## Detailed Description

Omni Arcade is a single app that brings multiple small games into one arcade-style experience. This README is meant to explain the project like a handoff note: what the idea is, why the repository exists, and how someone can start working with it without opening every file first.

The mobile workflow matters as much as the code. Device setup, emulator notes, signing expectations, and release commands should be kept visible so the app can move from local development to a real handset without guesswork.

At the top level, the most important entry points are `omni-arcade`. Together they show the current boundary of the project and make it easier to separate product code, support files, documentation, and experiments.

The declared Node surfaces include `omni-arcade` (scripts: `start`, `reset-project`, `android`, `ios`, `web`). Those package files are the best starting points for understanding how the app runs, builds, or validates itself.

The visible stack currently points to `React`, `React Native / Expo`, `Node.js`, `TypeScript`, and `JavaScript`. Keep this list honest as the project changes so the README remains useful as a first technical map.

## What It Includes

- A user-facing surface for the product, demo, dashboard, or static experience.
- A service layer for APIs, realtime behavior, bot logic, or server-side workflows.
- Mobile-ready project structure for wallet, Android, or app-focused development.

## How It Is Put Together

| Path | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `.gitattributes` | project file or folder |
| `omni-arcade` | project file or folder |

## Local Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ENZOMOTIVE/omni-arcade.git
cd omni-arcade
```

```bash
cd omni-arcade
npm install
npm start
```

## Command Surface

| Area | Commands |
| --- | --- |
| `omni-arcade/package.json` | `start`, `reset-project`, `android`, `ios`, `web`, `lint` |

## Configuration

- Document API ports, database URLs, third-party credentials, and service endpoints in `.env.example` before deployment.
- Keep signing keys, platform credentials, and build profiles outside the repository.

## Quality Checks

- From `omni-arcade`, run `npm run lint`.

## Where To Take It Next

- Add screenshots or a short user flow so visitors can see the interface before running it.
- Document the main API routes, bot events, or service responsibilities with example inputs and outputs.
- Add emulator, device, signing, and release notes for the mobile workflow.
- Keep setup commands current whenever dependencies, scripts, or deployment targets change.
- Record important product decisions here so the repository keeps its story as the code evolves.
